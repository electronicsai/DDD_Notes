## Chapter 9. Modules

### Big Picture
- Modules serve as named containers for domain object classes that are highly cohesive with one another. The goal should be low coupling between the classes that are in different Modules.
- Give Modules names that become part of the Ubiquitous Language. 
- Modules can be implemented easily with C# namespaces.
